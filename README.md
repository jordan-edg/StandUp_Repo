Hello! Welcome to the repository for the StandUp project.

To test the artefact, please make sure you download:

StandUp.ipynb 
StandUp_Dataset_Final.csv
StandUp_Embeddings_Final.parquet

The other files are supplementary:

StandUp_Embeddings.parquet was the first attempt, vector_store_original was the first version of StandUp - and the one that the first query datasets were created with.
standup_embedding.py will be needed if you wish to create your own embeddings, or want to test the script. You will need your own OpenAI API key.

I have included all other datasets used in the project as a supplementary resource.
